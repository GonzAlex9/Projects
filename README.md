Individual projects.  
Here there are some projects that i create in my free time to improve and experiment new technologies.

**- Servomotor-contrassenya**  
A Project based on Arduino.  
With a controller, we can introduce a password and if it's correct, the servo motor moves.  
A simple but a curious project. The objective is to have more knowledge about the harware and software interactions.
